    <h1>Welcome to <br>
        WACH-AN-ANIMAL</h1> 
    <h2>The goal of the game is to reach a thousand points by clicking on every animal (worth 10 points) and carrot (because animals like them so much they're worth extra points: 100!) that crosses the screen.         Careful! Some of the creatures on your screen will not be animals! You will lose 50 points for every single one of them you click on. If the counter reaches zero you would have lost.<br>
        <br>
        If I were you I would avoid Taka, this time he's not here to help you... <br>
        If you look at the background you can see how the season change whilst you play. <br
